"chandra_obsid_finder.py" is the executable. This should be run in Inigo and designed for Python 3 and Ciao 4.10. 

The required file is the "atalog_members_relevant.fits" generated from "Checking Sources" This will generate a directory named "Locations_ch_fnd_obsid" and will fill it with text files, which can be deleted if desired. This will output "match_table.fits" and "no_match_table.fits" which has the galaxies with and without Chandra observations}
