# DES_AGN_Tesla
Some of the code I have or organize and analyze AGN candidates using Dark Energy Survey and Chandra Data

The contents of this file are the following: 

“Checking Sources”: This file is used to generate the initial tables for AGN matches and the filtering of the member catalog to include only relevant galaxies. 

“Finding Chandra Obsid”: This file is used to run the “find_chandra_obsid” on ciao multiple times and condenses it all to a single table. 

“Analysis”: This file combines data from both of the above and provides some histograms and other analysis graphs. 

Should you be running from the beginning, this should be run in the above order. In each file is a README which has all the relevant information. If you need more information, please email me at rnoorali@hotmail.com
